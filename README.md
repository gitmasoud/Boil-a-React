# Boil-a-React

##### Creating a React App
This is another clean implementation of a boilerplate similar to Create-React-App.

It was built purely for testing and learning purposes.

##### Getting Started
(Note: this project was created in Node v9.3.0)

Clone this repo over on the Github repository https://github.com/gitmasoud/Boil-a-React into your local
directory and then install dependencies with npm install.

Now you will have your boiler plate ready to start playing with.

##### Starting The Dev Server
To start the server and start hacking, run

```npm start```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up a simple bare bones with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in .src should cause pages to reload on Save.

### NOTES:
You will notice there is a command for ```npm i boil-a-react``` but as of latest version, you can yet install the package this way and then import it into another external project... If you you how to fix it then please contribute! :-)
